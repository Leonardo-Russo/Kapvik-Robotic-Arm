# Project Report: Rover Manipulator Analysis

## Introduction to the Manipulator

This project focuses on the analysis of a rover manipulator, ensuring compatibility with the given link parameters. The rover is approximated as a box-shaped structure with specific dimensions. A crucial phase involved defining the Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (MDH) parameters for the Kapvik robotic arm, essential for accurately representing the arm's mechanics.

### Key Components of the Analysis

- Modified Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters: Detailed for precise representation of the arm's mechanics.
- Transformation Matrices: Establish relationships between each reference frame, including rotation and translation components.
- Tool Reference Frame: Defined in relation to the wrist frame and adjusted based on design parameters.

## Forward and Inverse Kinematic Analysis

- Forward Kinematics: Computed using the MDH table and transformation matrices, focusing on the relationship between the manipulator base and the wrist of the manipulator.
- Inverse Kinematics: Involves finding the set of joint angles to reach a specified position and orientation. A closed-form strategy was adopted for an algebraic solution.

## Jacobian and Dynamic Equations

- State Vector Definition: Defined in terms of joint angles and trajectories.
- Inertia Properties: Involving the correct masses for evaluating the center of mass of each link.
- Path Vectors: Define vectors connecting each reference frame to the next and with the center of mass.
- Iterative Newton-Euler Dynamic Algorithm: Used to compute linear and angular acceleration, inertia forces and torques.

## Main Task: Trajectory Generation

- Operational Configuration: Focuses on the trajectory design from stowage to navigation, and from stowage to sample retrieval and deposition.
- Trajectory Interpolation: Employed linear functions of time with parabolic blends at specific points.
- Control System Design: Utilizing the control-law partitioning method, incorporating model-based portions and servo portions.

## Conclusion

The project successfully analyzes the rover manipulator using detailed kinematic and dynamic models. The application of MDH parameters, transformation matrices, and trajectory generation techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the manipulator's mechanics and control strategies.
